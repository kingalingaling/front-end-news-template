## My process
I built using html and bootstrap, designing and styling the easy aspects simultaneously. After this, I added the remaining aspects of the design bit by bit.
I also designed the site from top to bottom using CSS flex and managed to solve all the responsive aspects
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5.3.1

### What I learned

I got back into the process of remembering how to use css and bootstrap. It was pretty easy once I started to remember grids and some other classes. I also learnt how to use flex and media queries for responsiveness


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me do some css stuff; refreshed my memory on some bootstrap functionalities too
- [MDBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) - This site helped me with bootstrap functionalities too. Also provided some code snippets
